This is the document. Let’s make it great.\nlibrary(readxl) # For importing Excel files library(haven) # For importing Stata files library(tidyverse)  The Wharton Residential Land Use Regulation Index (WRLURI) is an aggregate index measuring the regulatory constraint on development in a neighborhood. The index was originally published in 2008 and an updated version was published in 2018. For this analysis, I use the 2008 version. The data are downloaded as a Stata Data file, so I use the read_dta function from the haven package to import it.\nThe data set includes a lot of variables on the on answers to the questions used to create the WRLURI. I limit the data set to just the geographic variables, state name and ufips, and the WRLURI. Furthermore, I drop places in Alaska and Hawaii. These states are not included in the natural amenities index. Also, some entries have been included in the data set for which the WRLURI wasn’t calculated, and I drop these observations as well/\nwrluri_raw \u0026lt;- read_dta(\u0026#34;WHARTON LAND REGULATION DATA_1_24_2008.dta\u0026#34;) |\u0026gt; select(statename, ufips, WRLURI) |\u0026gt; filter(!is.na(WRLURI), !statename %in% c(\u0026#34;AK\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;HI\u0026#34;)) glimpse(wrluri_raw) ## Rows: 2,605 ## Columns: 3 ## $ statename \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;AL\u0026#34;, … ## $ ufips \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 45784, 33448, 57048, 20104, 3076, 14392, 5980, 57120, 50192,… ## $ WRLURI \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; -1.14343214, -0.80467761, -1.52855742, -1.29472172, -0.20321… Taking a glimpse at the data, we see there are 2605 place observations. statename is a character variable giving the two letter state abbreviation, ufips is a dbl variable for the place code within the state, and WRLURI is the regulation index. statename and ufips should uniquely identify places in the data set, which I first check for.\nwrluri_raw |\u0026gt; count(statename, ufips) |\u0026gt; filter(n \u0026gt; 1) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## statename ufips n ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; ## 1 CT 62710 2 ## 2 FL 62500 2 In fact, we see two places, one in FL and one in CT, have multiple observations. Without having any additional data on why I have these two duplicates, I will take the average of their WRLURI scores for the place WRLURI. Also, ufips being an identifier should really be a character variable. Since it is numeric, the leading 0s in the 5 digit codes have been dropped, which could cause problems when joining this data to other data. I add back in the leading 0s and make it into a character type.\nwrluri \u0026lt;- wrluri_raw |\u0026gt; group_by(statename, ufips) |\u0026gt; summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean), .groups = \u0026#34;drop\u0026#34;) |\u0026gt; mutate(ufips = str_pad(as.character(ufips), 5, \u0026#34;left\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;0\u0026#34;)) We have the WRLURI data at the Census place level. The natural amenity data is at the county level. Therefore, I need to use the WRLURI data to assign regulation scores at the county level. To do this, I have to connect Census places to counties. The best resource for this is the Mable Missouri site. I download a crosswalk file from there in geocorr2000.csv.\ncounties_cross_raw \u0026lt;- read_csv(\u0026#34;geocorr2000.csv\u0026#34;, skip = 1) head(counties_cross_raw) ## # A tibble: 6 × 10 ## county cousubfp `FIPS state` placefp `State Postal Code` cntyname ## \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; ## 1 01001 90171 01 03220 AL Autauga AL ## 2 01001 90171 01 99999 AL Autauga AL ## 3 01001 90315 01 06460 AL Autauga AL ## 4 01001 90315 01 99999 AL Autauga AL ## 5 01001 92106 01 99999 AL Autauga AL ## 6 01001 92628 01 48712 AL Autauga AL ## # … with 4 more variables: `County Subdivision Name` \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, `Place Name` \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt;, ## # `Total Pop, 2000 census` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt;, `placefp to county allocation factor` \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; Inspecting the data, we see that each county has its population broken down by county subdivision (cousubfp) and place (placefp). The ufips code in the WRLURI data actually represents either a county subdivision or a place code. Therefore, in joining the two data sets, we need to join ufips on each of these codes. Also, take into consideration that for some places within counties the cousubfp and placefp are the same. Therefore, after joining the data, I create one WRLURI score for each part of a county by using the WRLURI value found in the WRLURI column from either join.\nwrluri_counties \u0026lt;- counties_cross_raw |\u0026gt; rename(statename = `State Postal Code`, pop = `Total Pop, 2000 census`) |\u0026gt; left_join(wrluri, by = c(\u0026#34;statename\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;placefp\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;ufips\u0026#34;)) |\u0026gt; left_join(wrluri, by = c(\u0026#34;statename\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cousubfp\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;ufips\u0026#34;)) |\u0026gt; mutate(WRLURI = if_else(!is.na(WRLURI.x), WRLURI.x, WRLURI.y)) Now for each part of a county, we have that parts population and the WRLURI index if one exists in the data. To create a WRLURI index for each county, I calculate a population weighted average of all the WRLURI scores that I have for that county. I first drop all county parts without any WRLURI score. In the resulting data, only counties where some part of the county has a regulation score are included.\nwrluri_by_county \u0026lt;- wrluri_counties |\u0026gt; …","date":1657584000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657584000,"objectID":"9c2a5dc4a635e1a66c3dd8eb6729834f","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/post/regulation-amenities/reg_amens/","publishdate":"2022-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/regulation-amenities/reg_amens/","section":"post","summary":"I start by loading the packages I will need for the analysis.

Researchers have posited that this trend implies that these heavily regulated cities are experiencing higher incidences of gentrification. However, the gentrification of lower-income communities may be negatively influenced by restrictive regulations rather than positively, as is the case with overall housing price growth. This may occur if restrictions make it more difficult to improve housing structures and engage in new housing projects. We use data from over 12,000 census tracts to analyse the relationship between land use regulations and the probability an area will undergo gentrification in the years 2000 to 2010. By separating the influence of higher levels of regulation on overall housing price growth from the likelihood that a lower-income neighbourhood will gentrify, we find that regulation has opposing forces. While increased levels of regulation are associated with an almost 10% greater increase in overall housing prices, they are also associated with a three to four percentage-point lower probability that a lower-income tract will experience gentrification, contrary to previous conclusions.","tags":null,"title":"The Influence of Land Use Regulation on the Probability That Low-Income Neighbourhoods Will Gentrify","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
